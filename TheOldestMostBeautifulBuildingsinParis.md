# The Oldest & Most Beautiful Buildings in Paris
*Known for its fashion, food and culture, Paris remains a fascinating capital to explore, in one of the most visited countries in the world. The city never fails to enthral and its offerings can be overwhelming, but let us guide you through nine of the oldest buildings worth visiting.*
#### Notre Dame de Paris
- Construction on this beautiful Gothic cathedral started in 1163 and took over 100 years to complete; in a collaborative process where the Catholic Church and the entire population of Paris participated—with money, work craft or knowledge. **Maurice de Sully** was the Bishop of Paris in 1160 and he is central to the origin of the Notre Dame. He **wanted to honor Mary, hence the name Notre Dame de Paris, which translates as Our Lady of Paris.**![Notre Dame de Paris](https://en.parisinfo.com/var/otcp/sites/images/node_43/node_51/node_77884/node_77888/cath%C3%A9drale-notre-dame-de-paris-vue-panoramique-%7C-630x405-%7C-%C2%A9-fotolia-rdnzl/11884072-1-fre-FR/Cath%C3%A9drale-Notre-Dame-de-Paris-Vue-panoramique-%7C-630x405-%7C-%C2%A9-Fotolia-rdnzl.jpg)
### La Sainte-Chapelle
 - It is not known when construction began on this beautiful church, however historians believe it was completed in 1248. The edifice is separated into two floors; downstairs, where the chapel stands, and upstairs, where the royal relics are kept. Two fires, one flood and a revolution have contributed to its history. **During the latter, the church’s external decorations were destroyed, along with anything inside that represented affluence and royalty.** Today, this monument is famous for its outstanding stained glass.![La Sainte-Chapelle](https://cache-graphicslib.viator.com/graphicslib/thumbs674x446/37736/SITours/skip-the-line-sainte-chapelle-in-palais-de-la-cit-in-paris-481013.jpg)
 ### La Conciergerie

 - Located on the western portion of Île de la Cité, an island in the River Seine, this wonderfully imposing gothic behemoth was built in the 14th century. It was initially meant to be part of the royal palace, but was turned into a prison during the revolution. La Conciergerie housed the Revolutionary Tribunal, as well as convicts headed for the guillotine. **According to some records, over two thousand prisoners were sent to their deaths from this prison, including some famous personalities—Marie Antoinette, Robespierre (the Tribunal’s first head) and Napoleon III were imprisoned here before being beheaded.** ![La Conciergerie](https://www.parisdigest.com/photos/conciergerie_prison_paris.jpg)
